###Determining geometric shape type

shape=input('Which type of shape do you want to find out? (triangle or  quadrilateral): ')

if shape == "triangle":
    a=float(input('Please enter the first length: '))
    b = float(input('Please enter the second length: '))
    c = float(input('Please enter the third length: '))

    if abs(a+b)>c and abs(a+c)>b and abs(b+c)>a:
        if a==b and b==c:
            print('It is an equilateral triangle')
        elif (a==b and b!=c) or (a==c and a!=b) or (b==c and b!=a):
            print('It is an isosceles triangle')
        elif a!=b and b!=c:
            print('It is a scalene triangle')
    else:
        print('Does not specify a triangle.')

elif shape=="quadrilateral":
    print('Please enter the edges in order')
    a = float(input('Please enter the first length: '))
    b = float(input('Please enter the second length: '))
    c = float(input('Please enter the third length: '))
    d = float(input('Please enter the fourth length: '))

    if a==b and b==c and c==d:
        print('It is an square')
    elif a==c and b==d:
        print('It is a rectangle')
    else:
        print('It is a quadrilateral.')
